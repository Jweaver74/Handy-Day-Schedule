## Why I made this site
The code was given to us to be able to demonstrate the skills of using API's along with DOM.

## What I learned
I was able to use the API dayjs to be able to load the current day and time and upon
refreshing the page the time will change. Also using dayjs i was able to set up the function to be able to highlight the current time for notes as well as the past and future times for easy access.

## Challenges 
The dayjs was harder to navigate at first and took alot of searching for the answer to
be able to have the right format diplayed.
